## Content of the task given include:
• Java Servlet
• JSP
• Git
• JUnit/Mockito
• SQL
• JDBC

### java servlet: 
- A Java Servlet is a Java 
programming language class that extends 
the capabilities of servers hosting 
applications accessed via a request-response 
programming model. Servlets are commonly 
used to process or store a Java server's
request and response objects, handling 
tasks such as reading data sent by an HTML
form, processing that data, interacting 
with databases, and generating dynamic web 
content.
- In summary, Java Servlets are a powerful way 
to build server-side applications 
that handle client requests and generate dynamic web content, forming a crucial part of Java's web application development ecosystem.
### JSP:
- JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a server-side technology used to create dynamic, platform-independent web content. JSP allows the embedding of Java code directly into HTML pages, which are then compiled into servlets by the server. This technology simplifies the creation of dynamic web pages by allowing developers to write HTML and Java code in a single file.
- JSP is a powerful tool for building dynamic, interactive web applications by leveraging Java's capabilities directly within HTML pages.
### Difference between JSP and Servlet
- JSP: Simplifies the creation of dynamic web pages with embedded Java code, ideal for the view layer. 
- Servlet: Handles complex request processing and business logic, ideal for the controller layer.

### JDBC (JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY)
- is a Java API for connecting and interacting with relational databases. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that enable Java applications to execute SQL statements, retrieve results, and manage database connections.
- JDBC provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for Java applications to interact with relational databases, enabling seamless integration of database functionality into Java applications.

## in summary:
- while JSP(javaServer page) focuses on the 
dynamic rendering html page from the backend
by injecting java code in it - Servlet handles
the HTTP connection (internet doings) end point (business logic)
and the dynamic content generation that
would be rendered using JSP - JDBC java
database connectivity is the API that connects
the Servlet to the Database. providing
giving servlet the ability to query the database
